                    Chef Boy is a 3d action/adventure game where a chef must traverse around an alien
                    world and collect ingredients for the ultimate recipe. There are different enemies to
                    fight and terrain to explore. The character can be controlled with WASD to move and mouse
                    to attack or block attacks.

                    Ever since I started programming, I've wanted to crate a game using 3D graphics. I knew
                    this project will be significantly more difficult than my previous project (Toony Wars).
                    Although this project was more difficult, the challenge motivates me as strive to put more
                    effort in the project.

                    Throughout this project, I've learned many useful technical skills and soft skills. As this
                    project is heavily object oriented, I started by working with my team and creating a comprehensive
                    UML diagram to plan out the relationships between each class. I implemented OOP concepts such as
                    inheritance, abstraction, polymorphism, and encapsulation to reduce complexity and improve code
                    readability. I've implemented data structures such as nodes, lists, and queues so that I can have
                    a better understanding of how to use them practically. I utilized sorting algorithms to
                    organize the items in game. Blender is used to create the models in the game. The JMonkey engine
                    was used to render the 3D graphics and control shaders and lighting.

                    I learned many technical skills from this project, but just as importantly, I learned many other
                    skills to help me accomplish this project. I learned to use Github for version control and
                    collaborating with my group. I also learned how to more effectively research because I was
                    completely unfamiliar with the JMonkey engine. I learned how to use the engine through reading
                    documentation, online forums, youtube videos. My group and I had to research and find obscure
                    a obscure tool to convert Blender files into files used by the game engine.
